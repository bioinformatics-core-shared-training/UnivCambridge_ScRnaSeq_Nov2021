```{r Load}
sce <- readRDS("~/Course_Materials/scRNAseq/Robjects/caron_postSct_5hCellPerSpl.Rds")
```

## Challenge 1

Select top 2000 highly variable genes, calculate PCs and identify PCs linked to biological variation (using denoisePCA command). How many PCs remain after denoising? 

```{r yourCode1}

```
